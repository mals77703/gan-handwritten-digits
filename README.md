# gan-handwritten-digits
The project demonstrates how a DCGAN can generate synthetic handwritten digits resembling the MNIST dataset, using the generator to produce images and the discriminator to differentiate between real and generated ones, providing an educational tool for understanding GAN mechanics, convolutional layers, and deep-learning concepts.
